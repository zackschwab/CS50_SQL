# CS50_SQL

For my CS50 SQL project, I decided to create a database modeling a car dealership. I got this idea from working as a Lot Attendant and Accounts Payable Clerk
for a small independent car dealership.

## Academic Honesty 
Everyone taking CS50_SQL is allowed to upload their final projects to GitHub; you just can't upload problem sets. 

If you're currently taking this course DO NOT copy this code. Harvard will detect it and revoke your certificate.
