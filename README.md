# CS50_SQL

For my CS50 SQL project, I decided to create a database modeling a car dealership. I got this idea from working as a Lot Attendant and Accounts Payable Clerk
for a small independent car dealership.

## Usage
Install SQLite3 for this project by following the instructions [Here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm).

## Academic Honesty 
Everyone taking CS50_SQL is allowed to upload their final projects to GitHub; you just can't upload problem sets.
